# Python for Biologists - Website Documentation

## Core Purpose
This website supports a Python programming course designed for UK Year 3 Biology, Biochemistry, and Neuroscience students. The course teaches practical programming skills specifically for biological applications, with no prior coding experience required.

## Course Structure
- **5 Interactive Lectures**: Progressive curriculum from basic Python to data analysis
- **Hands-on Seminars**: Practical coding sessions with real biological problems
- **Capstone Project**: Gene analysis pipeline combining all learned skills
- **Google Colab Integration**: All exercises run in browser-based notebooks

## Design Philosophy
- **Biology-First Approach**: All examples and exercises use biological data and scenarios
- **Accessibility**: Dark theme with high contrast for better readability
- **Interactive Learning**: Slide-based lectures with embedded code examples
- **Professional Look**: Modern glassmorphism design with bio-themed colors

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, TailwindCSS vs4, React, Nect.js
- **Styling**: Custom bio-themed color palette (bio-blue: #00d4ff, bio-dark: #1a1a2e)
- **Layout**: Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- **Components**: Reusable card components, slide systems, navigation

## Key Features
- **Slide-based Lecture System**: Each lecture uses a slide presentation format
- **Status Badges**: Available/Coming Soon indicators for content
- **Resource Links**: Direct access to Colab notebooks, data files, cheat sheets
- **Course Schedule**: 5-week timeline with assignments and seminars
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices with hamburger menu

## Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Bio-blue (#00d4ff) - represents Python and programming
- **Backgrounds**: Dark gradients (bio-dark to bio-darker) for better code visibility
- **Accents**: Bio-yellow (#ffd700) for highlights, bio-green (#4CAF50) for success states
- **Gradients**: Purple gradients for special elements (seminars, advanced topics)
