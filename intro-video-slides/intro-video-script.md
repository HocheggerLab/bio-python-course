# Python for Biologists - Intro Video Script

 **Duration:** 1-2 minutes
**Speaker:** Helfrid Hochegger
**Target Audience:** Year 3 Biology, Biochemistry, and Neuroscience students

---

## Opening (10-15 seconds)

"Hello and welcome to Python for Biologists! My name is Helfrid Hochegger, and I'll be your guide as we explore how programming can transform the way you do biological research.

If you're feeling nervous about coding - don't worry. This course is designed specifically for biologists with no programming experience. By the end, you'll be amazed at what you can achieve."

## Why Python for Biology? (20-25 seconds)

"In modern biology, we're drowning in data - from genome sequences to protein structures, from microscopy images to clinical datasets. Python gives you superpowers to analyze this data efficiently.

Instead of spending hours on repetitive calculations in Excel, you'll write code that processes thousands of sequences in seconds. You'll automate the boring stuff, so you can focus on the exciting biological questions."

---

## Course Structure (25-30 seconds)

"Our journey is structured in three phases:

**First**, five interactive lectures covering Python fundamentals through biological examples. We'll start with DNA as strings, move through functions and data structures, and end with professional data visualization.

**Second**, ten hands-on seminar sessions where you'll practice with real biological datasets. The first five reinforce each lecture, while session six introduces your capstone project.

**Finally**, sessions 7 through 10 are dedicated to building your own gene analysis pipeline - a portfolio project you can be proud of."

## Learning Approach (15-20 seconds)

"Everything we do uses real biological data. You'll analyze DNA sequences, calculate molecular weights, process protein structures, and create publication-ready visualizations.

You can work directly in your browser using Google Colab - no installation needed. For those wanting a professional setup, we'll also guide you through VS Code installation."

---

## What You'll Achieve (15-20 seconds)

"By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- Automate laboratory calculations and data processing
- Analyze biological sequences and structures programmatically
- Create professional visualizations for your research
- Build complete analysis pipelines for your own projects

Most importantly I want you to gain the confidence to continue learning and apply Python to your own research challenges.

## Getting Started (10-15 seconds)

"All materials are freely available on our course website. You'll find interactive slides, practice notebooks, and comprehensive resources.

Remember - the only way to learn programming is by doing. So let's dive in, make mistakes, debug together, and discover the power of computational biology!"

## Alternative Shorter Version (60 seconds)

"Welcome to Python for Biologists! I'm Helfrid Hochegger.

Are you tired of manual calculations? Frustrated with Excel's limitations? Ready to analyze biological data like a pro? You're in the right place.

This course transforms biologists into programmers through five interactive lectures and ten hands-on seminars. No prior coding experience needed - we start from scratch and build up to professional-level bioinformatics.

You'll learn to analyze DNA sequences, automate lab calculations, visualize complex datasets, and build your own gene analysis pipeline. Everything uses real biological data - from E. coli genomes to protein structures.

We use Google Colab, so you can start coding immediately in your browser. Practice notebooks guide you step-by-step, and lab sessions provide personal support when you need it.

By the end, you won't just understand Python - you'll be using it to accelerate your research and tackle problems you never thought possible.

Ready to add computational superpowers to your biological toolkit? Let's begin!"
